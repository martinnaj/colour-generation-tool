# Colour Generation Tool

## This tool was created to serve to fulfill the following concept/idea

Given a source base HEX, calculate what was done to it (proportionally) to turn it into another (source result) hex,
call this proportional change "formula". Take hex "target base" and perform the same action to it, creating "target
result".

This tool is to be used when e.g. you see a website that makes nice use of different colours and shades, all based on
the same base
colour.

Your input hex will be used as a base colour. The same transformation will be applied to your colour, proportionally
(which should fix any issues that would arise if you were to enter a colour lighter or darker, and the transformation
method was to not be proportional)
